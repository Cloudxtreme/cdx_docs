have the system installed with raid-1

/dev/md0	/dev/sda1, /dev/sdb1
/dev/md1	/dev/sda2, /dev/sdb2

1.
	halt
	unplug 0:1
	boot
	degraded on md0, md1 (only has sda)

2.
	move 0:0 to 0:1
	boot
	still has sda (looks like "sda" name goes with the drive

3. 
	remove 0:0 and insert 0:1 to the first slot
	boot 
	failed on grub ???
	
4.
	insert 0:0 back to the first slot (now we have both drives)
	boot
	# mdadm -a /dev/md0 /dev/sdb1
	# mdadm -a /dev/md1 /dev/sdb2

grub> find /boot/grub/stage1
 (hd0,0)
 (hd1,0)
grub>
device (hd0) /dev/sda
root (hd0,0)   
setup (hd0)

device (hd0) /dev/sdb
root (hd0,0)     
setup (hd0)


NOTE: when drive 0:0 crashes, you need to move drive 0:1 to slot 1
