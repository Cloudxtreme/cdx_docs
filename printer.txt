Here's what I figured out from the CUPS documentation:
- There is an existing queue for the barcode printers
- Cups seems to be waiting for the barcode printer to finisha job before submitting another (the printer seems to take about 1 - 1.5 seconds)

Using a semaphore, we should be able to ensure that barcode print jobs from different users are sequentially ordered and not mixed up
Let's make sure that the semaphore works across multiple threads(in the mongrel scenario) and across multiple processes (Passenger/Fusion scenario)

Log in to lims server and as the rails user run the commands
lpstat -v (to get a list of printers)
lpstat -W all (to get a list of all jobs)
lpstat -W completed (to get a list of completed jobs)
lpstat (to get a list of pending jobs)

Thanks
