IT should not set-up new Quickbooks users. Finance (either Rob or Barbara usually creates new accounts).

Here's the typical process for users wanting to access Quickbooks though.

1. Finance will create a new Quickbooks user for the company file located on \\quickbooks\Quickbooks\Cardiodx.QBW.
2. On the users machine, install Quickbooks ES v12 on \\filesrv\it\software\QuickBooks\QuickBooksES_v12\Setup.exe
- Use the license key in the \\filesrv\it\Private\LicenseKeys.xls file.
- Install Quickbooks as is with no updates.
- Install the client only since the database is hosted on \\quickbooks
- Set-up Quickbooks for "Professional Services"
- Mount the \\quickbooks\Quickbooks path as a network drive
3. The user will be able to login to Quickbooks installed on any machine moving forward.
