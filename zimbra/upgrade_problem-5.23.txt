-- Looks like the old keystore didn't got migrated over.....
-- There are differences.  Can I just copy it over???

I am following instructions from 
http://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Administration_Console_and_CLI_Certificate_Tools#zmcertmgr

Esp. the following
Commercial Certificate Guidelines
Follow these guidelines when using this command to generate a commercial certificate.
The private key must exist in the /opt/zimbra/ssl/zimbra/commercial directory, and must be named commercial.key with its permission set to 740
The server certificate and the chain certificate files must exist in a temp directory. (E.g. /root/certs/)
The chain certificate files must be concatenated into one file called commercial_ca.crt

cp wildcard.cardiodx.com.key /opt/zimbra/ssl/zimbra/commercial/commercial.key
mkdir /tmp/certs
mv wildcard.cardiodx.com.crt /tmp/certs
cp ../../wildcard/gd_bundle.crt  /tmp/certs/
/opt/zimbra/bin/zmcertmgr deploycrt comm /tmp/certs/wildcard.cardiodx.com.crt /tmp/certs/gd_bundle.crt 

zmcontrol stop
zmcontrol start

Can we remove all the junk directories in /opt/zimbra/ssl -- they confuse the hell out of me.
The only directory that should exist is /opt/zimbra/ssl/zimbra
