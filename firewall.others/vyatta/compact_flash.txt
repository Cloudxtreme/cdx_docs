Install:
========

1 With the system still powered down, connect a VGA monitor and keyboard to the host.
2 Insert the Vyatta LiveCD into the CD drive and close the drive.
3 Power up the system.
NOTE Systems with a Flash device may boot slowly from LiveCD, as the system looks for DMA
that does not exist on the IDE device. This is expected behavior.
4
After the startup messages complete, the login prompt appears:
vyatta login:
5 Log on to the system as root with the password vyatta.
6 At the system command prompt enter the following:
install-system
The installer launches. The installer is an interactive install script that prompts you for some
basic information and confirmation during the install.
7 Follow the prompts and specify the compact Flash device name recorded above when
 required until a system prompt displays.
8 Remove the CD from its drive and reboot.
9 During the boot sequence press the appropriate key sequence (for example, <F2>) to
 interrupt the boot sequence and enter your system’s BIOS setup program.
10 In the boot sequence menu arrange the boot devices such that the compact Flash device
name (for example “IDE” or “SATA”) is first in the list so that the system will attempt to
boot from it first.
11 Save the settings and reboot the system. When the system restarts, it will be running from
the compact Flash and you will see the following:
Welcome to Vyatta - vyatta on tty1

Test the system
===============
1 Log on to the system as user vyatta with the password vyatta.
2 At the command prompt, enter the commands shown in the example, substituting an IP
 address on your existing subnet. In the example:
• The subnet is 192.168.1.0/24
• The IP address of the interface is 192.168.1.81
Make the appropriate substitutions for your network.
vyatta@vyatta:~$ configure
[edit]
root@vyatta# set interfaces ethernet eth0 address 192.168.1.81/24
[edit]
root@vyatta# commit
[edit]
root@vyatta# exit
exit
vyatta@vyatta:~$
1 From another host on the same subnet, ping the interface to ensure that it is up.
2 From a Linux or Windows command prompt, enter the following command (substituting
 the IP address you assigned to the interface):
ping 192.168.1.81
If the Vyatta system is reachable, you will see replies from it in response to the pings.
If so, your system is installed and accessible on your network, and you are ready to review user
interface options and configure the system.
