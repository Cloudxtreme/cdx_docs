on 03/26/11, we've create bubble-pop checklist
  checklist id: 18100
  total samples: 61

on 03/28/11, RNA Extraction checklists had been created:
    18135, 18137, 18145, 18153
  we select checklist id: 18135
  there are 40 samples

Create a new rack v3_0_4_testing_rack
Place samples:
  http://cchoudesktop.cardiodx.com/
  beep in all blood tubes - 40 of them

Create a new checklist:
  (production: 18135)
  Checklist Name: v3_0_4
  Procedure - RNA Extraction
  Container ID: v3_0_4_testing_rack
    assign, save
    No more samples can be added to this checklist when saved.  continue?

    load hamilton output file

    Go to production - SCE - Retrieve T1041974_RNAxOutput.txt

Test senarios:

1) w/o 'Run ended' line:  ERROR: Incomplete Hamilton file; cannot load Transaction rolled back 
2) Change PAXGeneTube_6 from TRF45367C to TRF45367: ERROR Samples in the output file do not match what's in the checklist
3) Remove PAXGeneTube_6: Error in handling Extraction Output: 
													ERROR: Number of PAX Gene tubes does not match the number of matrix tubes in the output file Transaction rolled back
4) Remove PAXGeneTube_6, Matrix_TubeID_6, PAXGeneTubeVolume_TRF45367C: ERROR Samples in the output file do not match what's in the checklist
5) Change PAXGeneTube_6 to same as PAXGeneTube_5: ERROR Samples in the output file do not match what's in the checklist
																									Not checking for duplication at this time.

RNA Quant checklist ID: 18160

-- RNA Quant
--    Get the Spec Plate BC (AP007530) from the hamilton output file
--    In theory, the CLS will scan the Spec plate BC into RNA Quant.

Spec Plate ID/#: AP007530
Samples: Neg Control: 1053730489-SPEC
         TRF50393: 1053729452-SPEC

When verifying samples, it'll read TRFs from the database.

-- RNA Norm
--    Get the Matrix Rack BC (T1051812) from the RNAE hamilton output file
--    In theory, the CLS will scan the Spec plate BC into RNA Quant.

Find the bad sample first:
  OK, AP007530(H3) failed low 260/280
  Sample ID: 1053730505 (1053730505-SPEC)

  1) Remove it from the rack:
  Click 'Place Sample': 
  Container ID: T1051812
  Right click H3, then click 'Clear'
  
    Normally, CCL will:
      1) bring a new 'bad sample' rack
      2) beep in the bad sample
      3) the sample will be delted from this rack

  2) Add IRP: 1027825323
			(checked out by PYeung
				OK, check-in the rack first - T1033139
			)

   Since T1051812 is the BC of the rack, you'll need to find the 
   file and rename it from production.  
   OK, the file name is T1051774.........
										T1051774_RNA_Normalization_RT_Setup.txt

	   mv T1051774_RNA_Normalization_RT_Setup.txt /clims/data/cdna/norm_rtsetup/T1051812_RNA_Normalization_RT_Setup.txt

     vi T1051812_RNA_Normalization_RT_Setup.txt
