> Here are the steps to get proxy authentication working:
> - First create a super user - dnalims for e.g.
> - use sqlplus to connect as admin to your copy of ccllims database and
> execute the command
>    ALTER USER blin GRANT CONNECT THROUGH dnalims
>    This line has to be repeated for all users in the db (Chialin can
> do this as part of the IQ for the production system
> - In the application controller within rails
> 1) use before_filter to check user login (blin) against ldap(like in
> plims)
> 2) if already authenticated, just get the username from the session 
> 3) Then call
>   ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection with username as
> dnalims[blin], password as dnalims_password
> 4) Also use after_filter to create a funtion called
> close_proxy_session with the line
>   ActiveRecord::Base.close_connection
> 
> What this does is every time a use clicks a link or indirectly a
> javascript call is made to the rails app, it will establish a
> connection in to the db, perform the sql and then close the connection
> for that user. 
> That is very inefficient and I have other ideas on how to speed it up
> if it has unacceptable performance.
